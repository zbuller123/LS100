Set up a clean Python 3.12 environment and verify required packages.\n","2. Understand each step and terminologies.\n","3. Download and select a Pose Landmarker model (**lite / full / heavy**) and understand accuracy–speed trade-offs.\n","4. Read videos with OpenCV and run inference in **`RunningMode.VIDEO`** with correct **timestamps**.\n","5. Export results as tidy CSVs for analysis: **2D image-normalized** and **3D world** landmarks.\n","6. Create an **annotated MP4** showing the skeleton overlay.\n","7. Build intuition for **visibility**, **image vs. world coordinates**, and simple feature engineering (e.g., joint angles).\n","\n","> **Built for learning:** Along the way you’ll see short callouts explaining *why* each step exists (e.g., timestamps in VIDEO mode), how coordinate spaces differ, and how to tune speed vs. accuracy.\n","\n","## After completing this guide, you will be able to\n","\n","* Load one video—or loop through an entire folder—and extract the coordinates of the landmark bodypoints frame-by-frame.\n","* Save two analysis-ready CSVs per video: one for **2D normalized** landmarks and one for **3D world** coordinates.\n","* Produce an **annotated MP4** with landmarks and connections overlaid.\n","* Explain and adjust **`RunningMode.VIDEO`**, **per-frame timestamps**, **visibility filtering**, **image vs. world coordinates**, and model variants (**lite/full/heavy**).\n","\n","> **Prerequisites**\n",">\n","> * Python **3.12** virtual environment selected as the active Jupyter kernel.
